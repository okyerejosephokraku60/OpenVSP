HOW TO USE OPENVSP IN TERMUX.

OpenVSP, or Open Vehicle Sketch Pad, is an open-source tool used for conceptual aircraft and spacecraft design. It allows the user to create a 3D model of a vehicle and analyze its aerodynamic properties, stability, center of gravity, and more.


Here are some basic commands in OpenVSP:

- To start a new design, click on "File" and select "New." Alternatively, you can also press "Ctrl+N."
- - To open an existing design, click on "File" and select "Open." Alternatively, you can also press "Ctrl+O."
- To create a new component, click on "Add" and select the type of component you want to add, such as "Fuselage," "Wing," or "Tail."
- - To modify a component, select it in the 3D view or the component tree, and then use the tools in the "Component" menu or the "Properties" window to make changes.
- To analyze the design, click on "Analysis" and select the type of analysis you want to perform, such as "Aerodynamics," "Mass Properties," or "Stability & Control."
- - To export the design as a file, click on "File" and select "Export." You can export the design in various formats, including "STL," "DXF," "STEP," and "DATCOM."

OpenVSP also has a command-line interface that allows you to perform various tasks using scripts. To access the command-line interface, open a terminal window and type "vsp --help" to see a list of available commands and options. You can use the command-line interface to automate repetitive tasks, run batch analyses, or integrate OpenVSP with other software.





OpenVSP is not available in Termux by default, as it is a tool primarily intended for desktop environments. However, it is possible to install OpenVSP on Termux using a package manager called "pkg" and running it in an X11 environment. Here are the steps to activate OpenVSP in Termux:

1. Install Termux on your Android device from the Google Play Store.
2. 2. Open Termux and type the following commands to update the package lists and install the necessary packages:
```
$ pkg update
$ pkg upgrade
$ pkg install x11-repo
$ pkg install xorg-xsetroot
$ pkg install openbox
$ pkg install pypanel
```

3. Install VcXsrv or Xming in your Windows computer. These are X Window System servers for Windows that allow you to run X11 applications remotely.
4. 4. Open the X server on your Windows computer and type the following command in Termux:
```
$ export DISPLAY=<IP address>:0.0
```

Replace <IP address> with the IP address of your Windows computer. You can find your IP address by typing "ipconfig" in a command prompt window on your Windows computer.

5. Download the OpenVSP binary for Linux from the official website. You can download the binary from http://www.openvsp.org/download.php.
6. 6. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a directory in Termux, such as the "Downloads" directory.
7. 7. Type the following command in Termux to make the OpenVSP binary executable:
```
$ chmod +x openvsp-linux-*.bin
```

Replace the asterisk with the version number of your OpenVSP binary.

8. Type the following command to run OpenVSP:
```
$ ./openvsp-linux-*.bin
```

Replace the asterisk with the version number of your OpenVSP binary.

9. OpenVSP should open in a new window. You can now start using it to create and analyze aircraft and spacecraft designs.
Note: Running OpenVSP on Termux might not provide optimal performance or compatibility with various features it offers. Thus, it is recommended to use OpenVSP on a desktop environment or platform that is specifically designed for it.
